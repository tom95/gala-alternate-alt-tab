# Gala Window Manager Alternative Window Switcher

This is an alternative to the stock libplank window switcher.

### Current status

**Warning!** This is still very alpha and in progress.

The plugin uses an unreleased Gala API for plugins.
Until it is ready, the project status will not change.

## Hacking

You will need the most recent snapshot of gala project from bzr.

Inside the repo, you will need to create a new folder in the `plugins`
folder and symlink the `Makefile.am` and `src/Main.vala` files.

Now update the gala `plugins/Makefile.am` and append the new plugin folder to
the `SUBDIRS` variable.

And update the gala `configure.ac` file to include the new path
`plugins/alternate-alt-tab/Makefile` in its `AC_CONFIG_FILES`.

Last thing you will need to install the schema file.
You can just symlink the file and run `glib-compile-schemas`.

Next, continue with the normal gala build instructions.

```bash
$ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$PWD/build
$ make
$ make install
```


### Testing

Running gala directly from `./build/src/gala` could result into a broken desktop.
To avoid this, consider using `Xephyr` (`apt-get install xerver-xephyr`).

You will need to start Xephyr and tell gala to use it.

```bash
$ Xepyr :1 &
$ ./build/bin/gala -d :1 &
```

Note: `:1` is just an ID, it can be a different number if **1** is already
being used. Consider increasing the number.

Now that you have gala build running in a virtual X server, you can launch
applications with the `DISPLAY=:1` environment variable set.

```bash
$ DISPLAY=:1 xterm &
```

Now switching to the Xephyr window, you can capture the mouse and keyboard and
test your build.

Alternatively, if you prefer running gala in your main session, you can just run
`./src/gala --replace`. If you break something and the wm crashes you will most
likely not be able to anything anywhere. To get yourself back running you can switch
to a different tty, login and run a different wm of your choice with the display
set to :0. For metacity that'd be for example `metacity -d :0`.
